## ✨ Features

- **Rotatable arrow launcher** — Use the left/right arrow keys to aim precisely before shooting.
- **Colour-matching pop mechanic** — Match 3 or more adjacent bubbles of the same colour to clear them, with a satisfying pop sound effect.
- **Floating bubble detection** — Bubbles that become disconnected from the main cluster after a pop automatically fall away, earning bonus clears.
- **Dynamic colour pool** — The next-bubble colour set updates in real time to only include colours still present on the board, keeping the game fair and winnable.
- **Next bubble preview** — See the upcoming bubble in the bottom-right corner so you can plan your shot.
- **Live score tracking** — Each popped bubble earns 10 points; score is displayed throughout the game.
- **Win & lose conditions** — Clear the entire board to win; lose if the bubble cluster descends to the launcher line.
- **Rotating soundtrack** — Three background music tracks (`Whatever It Takes`, `Goofy Theme`, `bgmusic`) play sequentially and loop automatically.
- **Replay without restarting** — After a win or loss, press `Enter` to instantly start a fresh game without closing the window.
- **Anti-aliased bubble rendering** — Smooth, clean circle graphics using `pygame.gfxdraw` for a polished look.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The game follows a straightforward **object-oriented + procedural hybrid** design, organised around a central game loop.

### Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Bubble` class | Sprite for both flying and grid-locked bubbles. Handles angle-based movement, drawing, and position. |
| `Ary` class | The rotatable arrow launcher sprite. Rotates via `pygame.transform.rotate`. |
| `Score` class | Tracks and renders the running score. |
| `bbarr` (board array) | A 20×25 2D list representing the bubble grid. Cells contain either a `Bubble` object or `'.'` (blank). |
| `stbb()` | Collision detection — places a flying bubble into the correct grid cell on impact. |
| `popbb()` | Recursive flood-fill that collects all same-colour neighbours for a potential pop. |
| `chkfflotrs()` | Detects and removes bubbles floating (disconnected from the top row) after a pop. |
| `updtclrlist()` | Re-computes the set of colours remaining on the board for the next-bubble pool. |

## ⚙️ Configuration

The game has no external config file. All tunable constants live at the top of `bubbleshooter.py`:

| Constant | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `FPS` | `120` | Target frames per second |
| `winwdth` | `940` | Window width in pixels |
| `winhgt` | `740` | Window height in pixels |
| `bubblerad` | `20` | Radius of each bubble (pixels) |
| `bubblelyrs` | `5` | Number of pre-filled rows at game start |
| `arywdth` | `25` | Grid columns |
| `aryhgt` | `20` | Grid rows |
| `clrlist` | 14 colours | Full palette of possible bubble colours |

To change any of these, open `bubbleshooter.py` in your editor and modify the values near the top of the file.

## 🎮 Usage

### Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `←` Left Arrow | Rotate launcher left |
| `→` Right Arrow | Rotate launcher right |
| `Space` | Fire bubble |
| `Enter` | Restart after game over |
| `Escape` | Quit the game |

### Gameplay Walkthrough

1. **Aim** — Hold the left or right arrow key to rotate the arrow launcher at the bottom-centre of the screen.
2. **Fire** — Press `Space` to launch a bubble in the direction the arrow is pointing.
3. **Bounce** — Bubbles bounce off the left and right walls, enabling angled trick shots.
4. **Match & Pop** — When your bubble lands adjacent to 2 or more bubbles of the same colour, all matching connected bubbles are removed and your score increases (+10 per bubble).
5. **Floaters** — Any bubbles left hanging (no longer connected to the top row) also disappear automatically.
6. **Win** — Clear every bubble from the board.
7. **Lose** — If any bubble in the grid touches the launcher line at the bottom, the game ends.
8. **Replay** — On the end screen, press `Enter` to play again or `Escape` to quit.

### Scoring

```
Each popped bubble  =  10 points
Floater bonus       =  10 points per floater removed
```

---

## 🧩 Code Deep-Dive

### Bubble movement (angle-based)

Bubbles travel at a constant speed of 10 px/frame. Direction is computed from the launch angle using standard trigonometry:

```python
xmove = math.cos(math.radians(angle)) * speed
ymove = math.sin(math.radians(angle)) * speed * -1  # negative = upward
```

Angles range from **0° (far right)** to **180° (far left)**. Straight up is **90°**.

### Wall bouncing

```python
if newbb.rect.right >= winwdth - 5:
    newbb.angle = 180 - newbb.angle   # reflect horizontally
elif newbb.rect.left <= 5:
    newbb.angle = 180 - newbb.angle
```

### Pop flood-fill (`popbb`)

A recursive depth-first search collects all bubbles of the same colour connected to the landing cell:

```python
def popbb(bbarr, row, col, color, dellst):
    # base cases: out of bounds, blank, wrong colour, already visited
    dellst.append((row, col))
    # recurse into all 6 hex-grid neighbours
```

If `len(dellst) >= 3`, all collected positions are blanked from the board.

### Hex-grid neighbour offsets

The board uses a **staggered hex grid** — odd rows are offset by half a bubble width. Neighbour offsets differ for even vs odd rows, which is why `popbb` and `popflotrs` both branch on `row % 2`.

---

## 🧪 Testing

There is no automated test suite in the current codebase. To manually verify behaviour:

| Test | How to check |
|------|-------------|
| Wall bounce | Aim at a sharp angle toward a wall and fire — bubble should reflect cleanly |
| 3-match pop | Land a bubble next to exactly 2 of the same colour — all 3 should disappear with a sound |
| Floater removal | Create a scenario where a pop disconnects a cluster from the top row — disconnected bubbles should vanish |
| Colour pool update | After several pops remove a colour entirely, that colour should no longer appear as a "next" bubble |
| Win condition | Clear all bubbles — end screen should read "You win!" |
| Lose condition | Let bubbles accumulate until they touch the bottom line — end screen should read "You lose!" |

To add automated tests in the future, consider extracting the pure logic functions (`popbb`, `chkfflotrs`, `updtclrlist`) into a separate module and using `pytest`.

## 🚢 Deployment

This is a **desktop application** — distribution options include:

### Option 1 — Share source (simplest)

Recipients clone the repo and run `python bubbleshooter.py` after installing Pygame.

### Option 2 — Package as a standalone executable with PyInstaller

```bash
# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Bundle everything into a single executable
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed \
  --add-data "Arrow.png:." \
  --add-data "bubbleshoot.gif:." \
  --add-data "bgmusic.ogg:." \
  --add-data "Goofy_Theme.ogg:." \
  --add-data "Whatever_It _Takes_OGG.ogg:." \
  --add-data "popcork.ogg:." \
  bubbleshooter.py
```

The output executable will be in `dist/bubbleshooter` (Linux/macOS) or `dist/bubbleshooter.exe` (Windows). No Python or Pygame installation required on the target machine.

### Option 3 — Package with cx_Freeze or Nuitka

Similar to PyInstaller but may produce smaller or faster binaries for specific platforms.

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

As a local desktop game with no networking, server, or user-data storage, the security surface is minimal:

- **No network calls** — the game is entirely offline.
- **No file writes** — scores are not persisted; nothing is written to disk during gameplay.
- **Asset loading** — all assets are loaded by relative path at startup. Ensure you run the script from the project directory to avoid `FileNotFoundError`.
- **Dependency hygiene** — keep Pygame updated: `pip install --upgrade pygame`.

---

## 📊 Monitoring and Logging

The game does not implement logging by default. To add basic diagnostics during development, insert standard Python logging at the top of `bubbleshooter.py`:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s %(message)s')
```

Useful events to log: bubble placement (row/col), pop counts, colour pool updates, and music track changes.

**Performance:** The FPS clock is set to 120 FPS (`fpsclock.tick(FPS)`). On low-spec hardware, reduce `FPS` to `60` to ease CPU usage.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Potential enhancements for future versions:

- [ ] **Persistent high score** — save and load top scores to/from a local file
- [ ] **Difficulty levels** — Easy / Medium / Hard with varying starting bubble layers and drop speed
- [ ] **Animated pops** — particle burst effect when bubbles are cleared
- [ ] **Touch / mouse support** — click to aim and shoot for mouse-only play
- [ ] **Level progression** — pre-designed puzzle levels with increasing complexity
- [ ] **Power-up bubbles** — special bubbles (bomb, wildcard, multiball)
- [ ] **requirements.txt / pyproject.toml** — proper dependency declaration
- [ ] **Automated test suite** — pytest unit tests for core logic functions
- [ ] **Pause menu** — ability to pause and resume mid-game
